# Nand2Tetris in VHDL

This project of myself is the VHDL realization of the very simple CPU
in course [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). Many thanks to
the professors and other contributors to this course.

It is rather easy for me to finish the course's hardware part since I was
majored in Microelectronics in university. Despite this, it is a quite
helpful course I will recommand to everyone!

The VHDL codes are all tested in EDA tools by simulation, but not on FPGA.
I have coded them carefully in a synthesizable way so it should be working
fine on FPGA. Might come back to this in the future, now just let me say it's
done.
